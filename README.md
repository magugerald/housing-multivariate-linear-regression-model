# Housing multivariate linear regression model

The task aimed to create simple linear regression models and a multivariate linear regression model using a housing dataset. The dataset contained 6 variables (PRICE, HEIGHT, WIDTH, SIGNED, PICTURE, HOUSE) and 431 observations.

In the simple linear regression model, two main variables were used for the first model.
That is, ‘PRICE’ and ‘WIDTH’ of the house. In the Second model, ‘PRICE’ and ‘SIZE’ were used.
The size was established by multiplying the ‘HEIGHT’ and the ‘WIDTH’ variables.

For the multivariate regression model, ‘PRICE’ was used as the dependent variable and
the rest variables were used as independent variables.
Results.

- The 1st simple linear regression model had excellent results in which the
  scatter plot of independent values and predicted dependent values,
  significantly lied on the regression line. The prediction error was approximately 22.85%.

- Also, the 2nd simple linear regression model had a similar result
  with the prediction error at approximately 22.89%.

- The multivariate linear regression model had good results with
  the prediction error at approximately 21.18%.
